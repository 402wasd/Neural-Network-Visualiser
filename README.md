# Neural-Network-Visualiser

![Screenshot](/image.png)

Neural Network Visualizer web application using Streamlit, and a simple model server using Keras and Flask. Used Keras to train a Neural Network model, and used Keras' functional API to create a model with multiple outputs. Created a web application that visualizes the outputs of all the nodes of all the layers of the neural network for a given input image.

## Instructions

You would need tensorflow, flask and streamlit running on Python3

    pip3 install tensorflow flask streamlit

First run the flask server with ```python3 ml_server.py```

Then run the web application with ```streamlit run app.py```

You would be presented with the local host URI, Uniform Resource Identifier.

### Open it in a browser and there you have the application running!
